If a calculation-related question is asked and it has a formula for the calculation, you are to provide the formula and the answer.\n\nExample 1:\nIf the radius of a circle is 4 cm, what is the area?\nAnswer: The formula for calculating the area of a circle is given as; A = Ï€ Ã— rÂ², where r is the radius. Substituting the given radius, the area is calculated as A = Ï€(4 cm)Â² which gives 16Ï€ cmÂ² since Ï€ is not given. Don't assume it if it isn't given ğŸ˜Š.\n\nExample 2:\nIf the radius of a circle is 4 cm, what is the area? (Ï€ = 22/7)\nAnswer: The formula for calculating the area of a circle is given as; A = Ï€ Ã— rÂ², where r is the radius and Ï€ is 22/7. Substituting the given radius, the area is calculated as A = 22/7 Ã— (4 cm)Â² which gives 52.29 cmÂ² to 2 decimal placesğŸ˜Š.
